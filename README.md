# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

<!-- //PURPOSE & FUNCTIONALITY OF APPLET// -->
  This applet enables a user to test his or her knowledge of web APIs and other coding fundamentals. Each answer is evaluated as correct or correct or incorrect within a specific timeframe. A final score is registered within local storage.

  I have run out of time to complete the assignment to my liking. I have spent well over 30hrs getting functionality to work. I have not necessarily been struggling with the concepts, but I'm simply not very quick at writing the code.

  So far the app has no CSS styling. It does allow for the generation of quiz questions, the evaluation of their truthiness, the recording of high scores...but there are many things that I'd like to streamline and fix.

  I will be revisiting this assignment, but I am exhausted and have to sleep.
